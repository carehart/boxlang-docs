# 1.0.0-Beta23

## Introducing BoxLang 1.0.0 Beta 23

The latest release of BoxLang, Beta 23, marks a significant step forward in our journey to create the ultimate dynamic language for the JVM. Packed with powerful new features, important bug fixes, and thoughtful optimizations, this update is designed to make your development experience smoother, faster, and more reliable, especially after now starting to take 100s of comments and bug reports from our community.

**Modularity** takes center stage in this release with the ability to define BoxLang components (aka Tags) within modules and a new version-checking mechanism that ensures module compatibility. Database interactions are now more intuitive with enhancements to the Generic JDBC Driver, and the introduction of the `getSemver()` function brings a robust tool for managing semantic versioning with precision and ease.

Debugging and performance have also seen [**major**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] improvements. The `dump` function now outputs directly to the console in scripting contexts, simplifying debugging workflows, while significant optimizations in functions like `len()` and the `DateTimeCaster` improve execution speed and efficiency. We've also addressed critical issues around argument handling, JDBC URL creation, and logging performance, ensuring a more stable and predictable environment for your applications.

Please continue to test your applications as we continue to push forwards towards stable release this winter.

## üöÄ New Features

1. **Component in BX for Modules** _(BL-750)_\
   Modules in BoxLang just got a serious upgrade! You can now build components for BoxLang using BoxLang.  No more Java ma!

```java
/**
 * This is a BoxLang only Component
 *
 * Annotations you can use on a component:
 * <pre>
 * // The alias of the Component, defaults to the name of the Class
 * @BoxComponent 'myComponentAlias'
 * @BoxComponent [ 'myComponentAlias', 'anotherAlias' ]
 * @AllowsBody [boolean=false]
 * @RequiresBody [boolean=false]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The runtime injects the following into the variables	scope:
 * - boxRuntime : BoxLangRuntime
 * - log : A logger
 * - functionService : The BoxLang FunctionService
 * - interceptorService : The BoxLang InterceptorService
 * - moduleRecord : The ModuleRecord instance
 *
 * The runtime also injects the following helpers into the variables scope:
 * - newBuffer() : Create and return a new StringBuffer
 * - newBuilder() : Create and return a new StringBuilder
 * - processBody( context, body, [buffer] ) : Process the body of a component
 * - getName() : Get the name of the component
 */
@BoxComponent 'HolaComponent'
@AllowsBody true
@RequiresBody false
class{

	/**
	 * The execution of this Component
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * <bx:holaComponent>This is my output</bx:holaComponent>
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @param context The context of the execution (IBoxContext)
	 * @param attributes The attributes of the component that were passed in
	 * @param body The body of the component that you can pass to `processBody(context, body, [buffer])` for execution and buffer retreival
	 * @param executionState The execution state of the component. Each component get's one as an isolated state.
	 *
	 * @return A BodyResult instance or null for a default result return.
	 */
	function invoke( required context, Struct attributes, any body, Struct executionState ){
		// A buffer to capture the body output
		var	buffer		= newBuffer();
		var	bodyResult	= processBody( context, body, buffer );

		// // If there was a return statement inside our body, we early exit now
		if ( bodyResult.isEarlyExit() ) {
			return bodyResult;
		}
		// // reverse the buffer contents and place into a string
		var newContent	= buffer.reverse().toString();
		// // output it to the page buffer
		context.writeToBuffer( newContent );
	}

}
```

2. **Module Compatibility Check** _(BL-768)_\
   The `ModuleService` now includes a powerful compatibility check for the "boxlang" version in your `box.json`. This ensures that your modules are running on a supported version of BoxLang, avoiding unexpected runtime issues.  Just add the `minimumVersion` to the `box.json` under the `boxlang` section and it will tell the Module Service which supported minimum version your module will work on.

```json
"boxlang": {
    "minimumVersion": "1.0.0",
    "moduleName": "test",
}
```

3. **Generic JDBC Driver Enhancement** _(BL-771)_\
   We've added a **default URL delimiter** to the Generic JDBC Driver. This improvement makes BoxLang more adaptable to various database configurations, simplifying JDBC URL handling for databases with unique delimiter requirements.
4. **New `getSemver()` BIF** _(BL-777)_\
   Introducing the `getSemver()` built-in function! You can now quickly parse or construct semantic versioning (**semver**) strings and work with them as `Semver` objects for enhanced version management.  The new BIF will parse and give you a `Semver` object to work with.  You can also use it to build fluent semantic version strings.

```cfscript
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3-alpha+20151212" )
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3-alpha" )
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3" )
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3+20151212" )
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3-alpha.1" )
var version = GetSemver( "1.2.3-alpha.beta" )

var version1 = GetSemver( "1.2.3" )
var version2 = GetSemver( "1.2.4" )
var version3 = GetSemver( "1.3.0" )

version1.compare( version2 ); // -1
version1.compare( version3 ); // -1
version2.compare( version3 ); // -1

var version = GetSemver().withMajor( 1 ).withMinor( 2 ).withPatch( 3 ).withPreRelease( "alpha" ).toSemver()
var versionString = GetSemver().withMajor( 1 ).withMinor( 2 ).withPatch( 3 ).withPreRelease( "alpha" ).toString()
```

## üîß Improvements

* **Console Output for `dump` in Scripting Contexts** _(BL-769)_\
  Debugging just got easier! By default, the `dump` function now outputs to the console when running in scripting contexts, making it seamless to debug CLI scripts.
* **Optimized `len()` Function** _(BL-770)_\
  The `len()` function is now smarter and faster! We've removed unnecessary date parsing, resulting in better performance.

***

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

* **Query Options Completion** _(BL-116)_\
  We've implemented unfinished query options, giving you more control and flexibility when working with data queries.

## üêû Bug Fixes

1. **`abort` in `cfdump` Tag** _(BL-761)_\
   Resolved an issue where using `abort` in conjunction with the `cfdump` tag caused unexpected errors.
2. **Whitespace Handling in HTTP Responses** _(BL-763)_\
   Improved handling of whitespace in responses where the `Content-Type` header was not yet set, ensuring better compatibility with various HTTP clients.
3. **Positional vs Named Arguments** _(BL-765)_\
   Fixed inconsistent behavior when handling arguments passed by position versus named.
4. **Invalid JDBC URLs** _(BL-772)_\
   Corrected the handling of the `dsn` key for JDBC drivers, ensuring compatibility with `cfconfig` replacements and producing valid JDBC URLs.
5. **Improved DateTime Performance** _(BL-774)_\
   Enhanced the performance of the `DateTimeCaster` and `DateTime` object instantiation when working with strings.
6. **Endless Recursion in `onSessionStart()`** _(BL-775)_\
   Addressed an issue where the `onSessionStart()` event could cause infinite recursion under certain conditions.
7. **`debugmode` in `boxlang.json`** _(BL-776)_\
   Fixed a problem where the `debugmode` flag was not being utilized as expected.
8. **Servlet Debug Mode Reconfiguration** _(BL-778)_\
   Resolved issues with reconfiguring debug mode in servlet-based environments.
9. **Logging Performance** _(BL-779)_\
   Overhauled the `LoggingInterceptor` to prevent inefficient recreation of appenders and loggers, especially under heavy stress.
10. **Missing `application` Argument in Logging** _(BL-780)_\
    The `writelog` and `log` components now properly support the `application` boolean argument.
