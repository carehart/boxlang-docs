# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/logo-gradient-dark.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**BoxLang** is a modern dynamic JVM language that can be deployed on multiple runtimes: operating system (Windows/Mac/\*nix/Embedded), web server, lambda, iOS, android, web assembly, and more. BoxLang combines many features from different programming languages, including Java, CFML, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP, to provide developers with a modern, functional and expressive syntax.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that we are in **open beta** and still have many things to complete before the stable release. Please be patient with us as we strive to achieve our goals.
{% endhint %}

BoxLang has been designed to be a highly adaptable and dynamic language to take advantage of all the modern features of the JVM and was designed with several goals in mind:

1. Be a rapid application development (RAD) scripting language and middleware.
2. Unstagnate the dynamic language ecosystem in Java.
3. Be dynamic, modular, lightweight, and fast.
4. Be 100% interoperable with Java.
5. Be modern, functional, and fluent (Think mixing CFML, Node, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure)
6. Extend via Modules
7. Be able to support multiple runtime environments:
   1. Native OS Binaries (CLI Tooling, compilers, etc.)
   2. Serverless Computing (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, etc)
   3. Servlet Containers - CommandBox/Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss/Undertow
   4. Docker Containers
   5. Android/iOS Devices
   6. Web assembly
   7. Etc
8. Compile down to Java ByteCode
9. Framework Capabilities (Scheduling, applications, events, async computing, tasks, queues, modules)
10. [Professional Open-Source Support](https://boxlang.io/plans)
